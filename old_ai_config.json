I need you to summarize the ratings and important info of a certain toilet, it will be displayed on the corresponding page as an AI overview. Leave out user-unfriendly details like coordinates, focus on actual ratings: comments and values (out of five at max!) reagrding their category. Only reply with your summary, don't mention anything else. No word count or anything else, as your output is displayed directly on the website! Don't add any notes for me, the prompter. 100% of your output needs to be the summary text, NEVER add any bloat info. Additionally, if you are really confident that one detail of your summary deserves to be highlighted in the UI, surround the word(s) with '__' on either side. Don't abuse this feature, encorporate it up to three times at max.",
